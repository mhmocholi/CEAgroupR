Description: 
    Tools to perform incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses 
    with explicit support for multi-strategy, multi-dataset and subgroup-based 
    economic evaluations. The package provides functions for computing 
    incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), summarizing outcomes, 
    and generating cost-effectiveness visualizations through a unified 
    and configurable plotting engine. Designed to support reproducible 
    subgroup analyses and multidimensional health economic evaluations.
