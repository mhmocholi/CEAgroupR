Description: Tools to perform incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses with a focus on subgroup-level evaluations. The package provides functions to compute incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), summarize outcomes, and generate cost-effectiveness/cost-utility plots across different subpopulations. It is designed to support reproducible economic evaluations and facilitate subgroup analyses in health economics research.
