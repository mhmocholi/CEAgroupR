\usage{
icers_base(
  data,
  group,
  cost,
  effect,
  R = 1000,
  lambda = 25000,
  ci_type = "bca",
  subgroup_vars = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a named list of data frames containing all
variables required for the analysis. All datasets must share the same structure.}

\item{group}{Character. Column name defining the comparison groups.}

\item{cost}{Character. Column name for total cost.}

\item{effect}{Character. Column name for the effectiveness measure
(e.g., QALYs, life-years).}

\item{R}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replications (default = 1000).}

\item{lambda}{Numeric or numeric vector. Willingness-to-pay threshold(s)
used to compute NMB. Defaults to 25000.}

\item{ci_type}{Character. Type of confidence interval for \code{boot.ci}
("bca", "perc", "basic", "norm").}

\item{subgroup_vars}{Optional character vector. Names of subgroup variables
to stratify the analysis.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{cea_results_list} containing:
\itemize{
\item One element per dataset (each a \code{cea_results} list with
Overall, Subgroups, and Summary).
\item A single tibble \code{$combined_replicates} combining all bootstrap
samples across datasets and subgroups.
\item A global \code{$settings} list (lambda, R, seed, date, etc.).
}
}
\description{
Performs nonparametric bootstrap resampling to estimate incremental cost,
incremental effectiveness, ICER, and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) between two
comparison groups (e.g., usual care vs. intervention). The function supports
multiple datasets (for scenario or sensitivity analyses) and optional subgroup
analyses. It can also compute NMB for multiple willingness-to-pay thresholds
(\code{lambda}) in a single run.
}
\details{
The returned object is hierarchical: each dataset contains its own overall and
subgroup analyses, while the root level stores the combined bootstrap replicates
and metadata. The structure is designed for transparent, reproducible
cost-effectiveness workflows.
