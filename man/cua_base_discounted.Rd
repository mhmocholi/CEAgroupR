\title{Simulated Single-Scenario Cost-Utility Dataset with Discounted Costs}
\format{
A data frame with 200 rows and the following variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{Individual identifier.}
\item{group}{Strategy group indicator (e.g. \code{"g0"}, \code{"g1"}).}
\item{sex}{Sex of the individual (\code{"female"}, \code{"male"}).}
\item{location}{Area of residence (\code{"urban"}, \code{"rural"}).}
\item{diabetes}{Diabetes status (\code{"yes"}, \code{"no"}).}
\item{HTA}{Hypertension status (\code{"yes"}, \code{"no"}).}
\item{n_comorbidities}{Number of comorbid conditions.}
\item{cost_total}{Total cost per individual after applying a 3\\%
annual discount rate.}
\item{effect}{Effectiveness outcome (e.g. QALYs), unchanged relative to
\code{cua_base}.}
}

Same structure as \code{cua_base}.

\description{
A simulated individual-level dataset designed to illustrate cost-utility
and cost-effectiveness analyses under a discounted cost scenario using the
CEAgroupR package. This dataset mirrors the structure of \code{cua_base},
but applies a uniform annual discount rate to cost outcomes.

Discounted version of the \code{cua_base} dataset. Costs and effectiveness
values have been adjusted using a discount rate for demonstration purposes.
}
\details{
All data contained in this dataset are fully synthetic and generated solely
for illustrative and methodological purposes. Variable distributions were
chosen to approximate plausible population-level prevalences in Spain
(e.g. diabetes and hypertension), but do not correspond to real individuals
or official microdata.

This dataset represents the same underlying population and strategies as
\code{cua_base}, but with costs discounted at a constant annual rate
(3\\%). It is intended to illustrate the handling of alternative analytical
scenarios within CEAgroupR, such as discounted versus undiscounted cost
analyses.
