\title{Summarize descriptive statistics for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) datasets}
\usage{
summarize_cea_data(
  data,
  group,
  cost,
  effect,
  subgroup_vars = NULL,
  lambda = 25000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a named list of data frames containing the
variables required for analysis. When a list is supplied, each element is
treated as a separate analytical dataset or scenario.}

\item{group}{Character. Column name defining the comparison groups (typically
a binary variable such as "control" vs. "intervention").}

\item{cost}{Character. Column name for total cost.}

\item{effect}{Character. Column name for the effectiveness measure
(e.g., QALYs or life-years).}

\item{subgroup_vars}{Optional character vector. Names of subgroup variables
to stratify the analysis. If \code{NULL}, only overall results are produced.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric or numeric vector. Willingness-to-pay threshold(s)
used to compute NMB. Defaults to 25000.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing descriptive statistics for all datasets and
subgroup levels. Each row represents one overall or subgroup summary, with
the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{dataset}: dataset name (or "single_dataset" if only one provided)
\item \code{subgroup_var}: name of the subgroup variable (or "Overall")
\item \code{subgroup_level}: level of the subgroup (or \code{NA} for Overall)
\item \code{n_g0}, \code{n_g1}: sample sizes per comparison group
\item \code{mean_cost_g0}, \code{mean_cost_g1}: mean total costs per group
\item \code{mean_eff_g0}, \code{mean_eff_g1}: mean effectiveness per group
\item \code{sd_cost_*}, \code{sd_eff_*}: standard deviations per group
\item \code{delta_cost}, \code{delta_effect}, \code{ICER}: incremental estimates
\item \code{NMB_*}: Net Monetary Benefit for each specified \code{lambda}
}
}
\description{
Generates descriptive summaries of the datasets used in a cost-effectiveness
or cost-utility analysis. The function provides counts, means, and standard
deviations for each comparison group and (optionally) for each subgroup
defined by the user. It also computes incremental statistics
(ΔCost, ΔEffect, ICER, and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)) for one or more
willingness-to-pay thresholds (\code{lambda}).
}
\details{
This function operates at the data level (not bootstrap level) and is designed
as part of the integration layer of the \pkg{CEAgroupR} package. It produces
a clean, tidy summary table that connects the analytical outputs generated by
\code{\link{compute_icers}} with the graphical layer.

This summary provides descriptive context to the bootstrap analysis performed
by \code{\link{compute_icers}}. It is not based on bootstrap replications, but on
the raw data used as input for the cost-effectiveness analysis.
}
\section{Function role}{

\code{summarize_cea_data()} replaces the functionality previously implemented
in \code{summary.cea_results()}, which is now deprecated. The current function
provides a unified and scalable approach that supports multiple datasets,
subgroup analyses, and flexible \code{lambda} specifications.
