\usage{
summarize_cea_data(
  data,
  group,
  cost,
  effect,
  subgroup_vars = NULL,
  lambda = 25000,
  ref_group = NULL,
  alt_groups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a named list of data frames containing individual-level
cost and effectiveness outcomes. When a list is supplied, each element is
treated as a separate dataset representing a distinct analytical scenario.}

\item{group}{Character string specifying the variable that identifies the
intervention or strategy group.}

\item{cost}{Character string specifying the cost variable.}

\item{effect}{Character string specifying the effectiveness variable
(e.g. QALYs or other health outcomes).}

\item{subgroup_vars}{Optional character vector specifying one or more subgroup
variables. When provided, summaries are computed independently for each
subgroup level in addition to the overall population.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric vector of willingness-to-pay thresholds used to compute
Net Monetary Benefits (NMBs).}

\item{ref_group}{Character string identifying the reference strategy.}

\item{alt_groups}{Optional character vector defining which alternative
strategies should be contrasted with the reference. If \code{NULL}, all
non-reference strategies observed in the data are used.}
}
\value{
A tidy tibble containing descriptive summaries for each dataset, subgroup and
strategy comparison, including:
\itemize{
\item dataset identifiers and subgroup metadata,
\item sample sizes per strategy,
\item mean and standard deviation of costs and effectiveness,
\item incremental outcomes (delta cost, delta effect),
\item ICERs and NMBs at specified willingness-to-pay thresholds.
}
}
\description{
Produces descriptive (non-bootstrap) summary statistics for cost-effectiveness
analyses by strategy comparison. This function computes sample sizes, mean
and standard deviation of costs and effectiveness, incremental values
(delta cost and delta effect), Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs),
and Net Monetary Benefits (NMBs) for one reference strategy contrasted with
alternative strategies.
}
\details{
Unlike \code{\link{compute_icers}}, this function does not rely on resampling
or uncertainty analysis. It is intended for descriptive reporting, baseline
summaries, and tabular outputs commonly required in health economic
evaluations and policy analyses.

The function supports:
\itemize{
\item single or multiple datasets representing alternative analytical
scenarios (e.g. base case, discounted analyses),
\item explicit subgroup analyses treated independently from the overall
population,
\item consistent summarization across strategies, subgroups and scenarios.
}

When subgroup variables are provided, summaries are computed separately for
each subgroup level in addition to the overall population. Subgroup levels
are automatically normalized as factors to ensure consistent ordering and
downstream processing.

The returned tibble is designed to support descriptive tables and reporting,
and is complementary to the bootstrap-based outputs generated by
\code{\link{compute_icers}}. It can be used directly for tabular summaries
or as input to custom reporting workflows.

\examples{
## Example 1: Descriptive summary for a single dataset
summary_base <- summarize_cea_data(
  data      = cua_base,
  group     = "group",
  cost      = "cost_total",
  effect    = "effect",
  ref_group = "g0",
  lambda    = c(20000, 30000)
)

head(summary_base)

## Example 2: Multi-dataset summary with subgroup stratification
data_list <- list(
  base_case        = cua_multi,
  discounted_case = cua_multi_discounted
)

summary_multi <- summarize_cea_data(
  data          = data_list,
  group         = "group",
  cost          = "cost_total",
  effect        = "effect",
  subgroup_vars = c("diabetes", "HTA"),
  ref_group     = "usual_care",
  lambda        = c(20000)
)

dplyr::count(summary_multi, dataset)
