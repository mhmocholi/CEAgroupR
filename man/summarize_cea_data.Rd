\title{Summarize descriptive statistics for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) datasets}
\usage{
summarize_cea_data(
  data,
  group,
  cost,
  effect,
  subgroup_vars = NULL,
  lambda = 25000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a named list of data frames containing the
variables required for analysis.}

\item{group}{Character. Column name defining the comparison groups.}

\item{cost}{Character. Column name for total cost.}

\item{effect}{Character. Column name for the effectiveness measure.}

\item{subgroup_vars}{Optional character vector. Names of subgroup variables.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric or numeric vector. Willingness-to-pay threshold(s).}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing descriptive statistics for all datasets and
subgroup levels.
}
\description{
Generates descriptive summaries of the datasets used in a cost-effectiveness
or cost-utility analysis. The function provides counts, means, and standard
deviations for each comparison group and (optionally) for each subgroup
defined by the user. It also computes incremental statistics
(ΔCost, ΔEffect, ICER, and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)) for one or more
willingness-to-pay thresholds (\code{lambda}).
}
\details{
This function operates at the data level (not bootstrap level) and is designed
as part of the integration layer of the \pkg{CEAgroupR} package. It produces
a clean, tidy summary table that connects the analytical outputs generated by
\code{\link{compute_icers}} with the graphical layer.
