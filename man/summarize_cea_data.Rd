\title{Summarize base statistics for CEA datasets}
\usage{
summarize_cea_data(
  data,
  group,
  cost,
  effect,
  subgroup_vars = NULL,
  lambda = 25000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a named list of data frames containing the
variables required for analysis.}

\item{group}{Character. Column name defining the comparison groups.}

\item{cost}{Character. Column name for total cost.}

\item{effect}{Character. Column name for effectiveness measure.}

\item{subgroup_vars}{Optional character vector. Variables for subgrouping.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric or numeric vector. Willingness-to-pay threshold(s)
for calculating NMB. Defaults to 25000.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing sample sizes, mean and SD of costs/effects,
and incremental statistics per dataset and subgroup.
}
\description{
Produces descriptive summaries of the datasets used in a cost-effectiveness
analysis, including counts per group and subgroup, means and standard deviations
of cost and effect, and incremental statistics (ΔCost, ΔEffect, ICER, NMB).
Supports multiple datasets and multiple willingness-to-pay thresholds.
