\title{Construct a Custom Shape and Linetype Specification}
\usage{
custom_shapes(shapes = NULL, linetypes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapes}{Optional numeric vector of ggplot2 shape codes
(e.g., \code{c(16, 17, 15)}).}

\item{linetypes}{Optional numeric or character vector of ggplot2 linetype
specifications (e.g., \code{c("solid", "dashed")} or \code{c(1, 2)}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"cea_shapes"} containing the validated
shape and linetype specifications.
}
\description{
Creates a validated object defining custom shape and/or linetype values
to be used by the CEAgroupR graphical engine. This constructor does not
perform any aesthetic mapping or recycling; it only validates inputs and
stores them in a structured object for later use.
}
\details{
The resulting object is intended to be passed to graphical functions
(e.g., \code{plot.ceacs}, \code{plot.icers}) via a dedicated argument and
resolved internally by the plotting engine.
}
