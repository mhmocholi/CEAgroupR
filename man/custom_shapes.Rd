\title{Define Custom Shape and Linetype Palettes for CEAgroupR Plots}
\usage{
custom_shapes(shapes = NULL, linetypes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapes}{Optional numeric vector specifying ggplot2 shape codes
to be used for point-based geometries. If \code{NULL}, default shapes
are used.}

\item{linetypes}{Optional character or numeric vector specifying ggplot2
line types to be used for line-based geometries (e.g. contours). If
\code{NULL}, default linetypes are used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"cea_shapes"} containing custom shape and/or
linetype definitions for use in CEAgroupR plots.
}
\description{
Constructs a custom shape and/or linetype palette to be used across
graphical functions in the CEAgroupR package. This utility allows users
to explicitly control the set of point shapes and line types used when
grouping results by a given variable (e.g. dataset or subgroup).
}
\details{
Custom shape palettes are particularly useful in complex visualizations
where default ggplot2 shapes or linetypes may be difficult to distinguish,
such as multi-dataset or multi-subgroup analyses.

The object returned by this function can be passed to graphical functions
such as \code{\link{plot.icers}}, \code{\link{plot.ceacs}} and
\code{\link{plot.evpis}} via the \code{shapes_palette} argument. Shape and
linetype values are recycled if the number of groups exceeds the length
of the supplied vectors.
}
\examples{
## Define a custom set of shapes and linetypes
my_shapes <- custom_shapes(
  shapes    = c(16, 17, 15),
  linetypes = c("solid", "dashed", "dotted")
)

## Use custom shapes in an ICER plane
res <- compute_icers(
  data      = cua_base,
  group     = "group",
  cost      = "cost_total",
  effect    = "effect",
  ref_group = "g0",
  R         = 50,
  seed      = 123
)

plot.icers(
  res,
  shape_by       = "dataset",
  shapes_palette = my_shapes
)

}
