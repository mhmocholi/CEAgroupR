\title{Launch Interactive CEAgroupR Dashboard}
\usage{
CEAgroupRui()
}
\description{
Provides an interactive Shiny dashboard for performing multistrategy,
multidataset and subgroup-based cost-effectiveness analyses using the
CEAgroupR package. The interface allows users to upload datasets, configure
analysis options, execute full bootstrap workflows, inspect summary tables,
and visualize results through ICER planes, CEACs, EVPI curves and marginal
distributions. All plots rely on the unified graphical engine
\\code{ce_plot_base}, ensuring consistent aesthetics across the application.
}
\details{
The dashboard uses a modern Bootstrap/bslib layout and supports PNG and PDF
exports of all visualizations. User-specified aesthetics override defaults.
