\title{Print Method for \code{cea_results} Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{cea_results}(x, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{cea_results}.}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying the number of decimal places to display.
Default is 3.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x}.
}
\description{
Provides a structured, human-readable overview of cost-effectiveness
analysis results stored in a \code{cea_results} object. This print method
summarizes bootstrap-based outcomes for both overall population analyses
and subgroup-specific analyses, when available.
}
\details{
The printed output is intended for quick inspection and interactive use,
and is not designed to replace formal tabular summaries or graphical
visualizations. Reference strategy information is retrieved from the
internal analysis settings attached by \code{\link{compute_icers}}.

Although primarily intended as an internal print method, this function
can also be called explicitly by users to control the formatting of the
output, in particular the number of decimal places displayed.

Comparison labels correspond to alternative strategies only, following
the standardized conventions used throughout the analytical layer of
CEAgroupR.

This method is automatically invoked when a \code{cea_results} object
is printed to the console. It provides a concise summary of key
bootstrap-based estimates to facilitate exploratory analysis and
diagnostic checks during interactive workflows.

\examples{
## Example: Print results with increased numeric precision
res <- compute_icers(
  data      = cua_base,
  group     = "group",
  cost      = "cost_total",
  effect    = "effect",
  ref_group = "g0",
  R         = 50,
  seed      = 123
)

print(res[[1]], digits = 5)
