\title{Print Method for \code{cea_base} Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{cea_base}(x, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{cea_base}, representing a single
strategy comparison.}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying the number of decimal places to display.
Default is 3.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x}.
}
\description{
Displays a formatted summary of bootstrap-based cost-effectiveness results
for a single incremental comparison between a reference strategy and one
alternative strategy. The printed output includes original estimates,
bootstrap means, bias, and percentile-based confidence intervals when
available.
}
\details{
This method is intended for detailed inspection of a specific comparison
extracted from a broader cost-effectiveness analysis, and complements the
higher-level summaries provided by \code{print.cea_results}.

The reference strategy is retrieved from the internal analysis settings
attached to the object by \code{\link{compute_icers}}. The alternative
strategy corresponds to the comparison stored in the \code{cea_base} object.

Although primarily designed as an internal print method, this function can
also be called explicitly by users to control the formatting of the output,
in particular the number of decimal places displayed.

This method is automatically invoked when a \code{cea_base} object is printed
to the console. It is most commonly accessed by extracting a single
comparison from a \code{cea_results} object.

\examples{
## Example: Inspect a single comparison with higher precision
res <- compute_icers(
  data      = cua_base,
  group     = "group",
  cost      = "cost_total",
  effect    = "effect",
  ref_group = "g0",
  R         = 50,
  seed      = 123
)

## Extract and print one comparison
print(res[[1]][["g1"]], digits = 4)

}
