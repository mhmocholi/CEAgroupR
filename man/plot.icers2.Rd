\description{
Produces cost-effectiveness planes from bootstrap replicates of
\code{cea_results} or \code{cea_results_list} objects. Supports multiple
visualization modes (\code{overall}, \code{datasets}, \code{subgroups},
\code{subgroups_datasets}, \code{full}) and adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE)
that automatically adjusts smoothness based on the bootstrap size.
}
\details{
KDE bandwidth is automatically scaled as \eqn{h \propto n^{-1/6}}.
Each facet and subgroup combination is treated independently, ensuring
that means and contours are computed only for their corresponding subset.
