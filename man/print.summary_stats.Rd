\title{Print method for summary statistics of CEA datasets}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary_stats}(x, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tibble produced by \code{\link{summarize_cea_data}}.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to display (default = 3).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
Nicely formats and prints the descriptive summary statistics created by
\code{\link{summarize_cea_data}} and stored in the \code{$summary_stats}
element of an object returned by \code{\link{icers_base}}.
}
\details{
Displays counts per group and subgroup, mean costs and effects, their standard
deviations (SD), and incremental results (ΔCost, ΔEffect, ICER, NMB) for each
dataset and subgroup combination. The dataset column is hidden in the printed
output (since it is already indicated in the section header) but remains in
the underlying tibble for programmatic access.
