\title{Print Method for Summary Statistics of Cost-Effectiveness Analyses}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary_stats}(x, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tibble returned by \code{\link{summarize_cea_data}}.}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying the number of decimal places to display
for numeric values (except sample sizes, which are printed as integers).
Default is 3.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x}.
}
\description{
Provides a formatted, human-readable display of descriptive summary
statistics generated by \code{\link{summarize_cea_data}}. For each dataset,
the output is organized into three compact tables:
\enumerate{
\item sample sizes by strategy,
\item mean and standard deviation of costs and effectiveness,
\item incremental outcomes including delta cost, delta effect,
ICERs and Net Monetary Benefits (NMBs).
}
}
\details{
Each row in the printed tables corresponds to a unique combination of
subgroup variable, subgroup level and strategy comparison. This print
method is intended for interactive inspection and preliminary reporting,
and complements the graphical and bootstrap-based outputs of CEAgroupR.

Although primarily designed as an internal print method, this function can
be called explicitly by users to control the formatting of the output,
in particular the number of decimal places displayed.

This method is automatically invoked when a summary statistics object is
printed to the console. It provides a structured overview of descriptive
cost-effectiveness results across strategies, subgroups and analytical
scenarios.

## Example: Print descriptive summaries with custom numeric precision
summary_base <- summarize_cea_data(
  data      = cua_base,
  group     = "group",
  cost      = "cost_total",
  effect    = "effect",
  ref_group = "g0",
  lambda    = c(20000, 30000)
)

print(summary_base, digits = 4)

}
